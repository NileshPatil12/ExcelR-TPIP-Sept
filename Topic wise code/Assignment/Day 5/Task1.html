    <h1>Gandhi Jayanti</h1>
    <h2>Significance of Gandhi Jayanti</h2>
    <p>
        Gandhi Jayanti, celebrated on October 2nd, commemorates the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, a key leader in India's
        struggle for independence.
        Known for his principles of Satyagraha (non-violent resistance) and truth, Gandhi played a crucial role in
        mobilizing the masses against British rule.
        His philosophies of peace, non-violence, and civil disobedience continue to inspire global movements for justice
        and equality.
        This day not only honors his contributions but also reflects on his timeless ideals.
    </p>
    <h3>Celebrations and Observances</h3>

        Across India, Gandhi Jayanti is observed with various tributes and events. At Raj Ghat, Gandhi's memorial in New
        Delhi, political leaders and citizens gather
        to pay their respects. The day is also marked as the International Day of Non-Violence, promoting his message of
        peaceful resistance. Schools and institutions
